1. Create a Layer Analysis
- Create a Packet Tracer simulation of network traffic, isolating a malfunctioning application, and analyze which layer of the OSI Model is causing the issue.

2. DDoS Mitigation Simulation
- Create an environment in Packet Tracer that simulates a DDoS attack on your network, implementing various mitigation strategies and documenting the effectiveness of each method applied.

3. Make an Advanced Routing Protocol Setup
- Make a complex network topology in Packet Tracer using OSPF, configuring it with multiple areas and illustrating how route summarization affects the routing table.

4. Inter-VLAN Routing Design
- Create a network design that utilizes a router-on-a-stick configuration in Packet Tracer, documenting the configuration steps and describing the communication process between devices in different VLANs.

5. Make a Troubleshooting Methodology Case.
- Make a simulation in Packet Tracer that represents a network failure, documenting each step taken in troubleshooting the issue, including commands used and their output, and explaining the methodology's application to future issues.

6. Create a Cloud Networking Simulation
- Create a Packet Tracer simulation demonstrating an IBM Cloud deployment across multiple cloud service providers (e.g., AWS, Azure), documenting how to establish inter-cloud routing and security policies in this hybrid cloud environment.

7. Make a Certification Study Guide
- Make a study guide based on key topics from networking certifications like CCNA or JNCIA, including hands-on exercises to be performed in Packet Tracer to enhance understanding of each subject area.
